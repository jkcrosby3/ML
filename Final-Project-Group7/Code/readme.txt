1.  email Ben Woodward at benjamin.woodward@cvisionai.com.  Tell him you are my professor and would like a username and password to download the code.  What I think he'll actually do is give you some code to run to download the images. I gave him a csv file and he will have created that code based off of the image names in that file.  He said he would give you access to the site where the images are located to look around if you wanted.  
2. I am assuming you have the same folder structure tha tyou wanted us to create in our Github.
3. In the Code folder, place 'train_finalproject.py' and 'image_folder.py'
4. Create a subfolder named 'data_subset_2'. Make sure labels.csv is in that folder
5. Create a folder named 'data_random'. put the 'Extractions_Download.py' file here and run it to download the images into this folder.  There should be 1500 images.
